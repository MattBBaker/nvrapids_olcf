# Instructions

The next instructions applies to NVIDIA Rapids ver. 0.11 and are intended for any SUMMIT's user, however you need to 
modify the scripts according to your project ID.

## Conda environment for DASK and NVIDIA Rapids users

DASK and NVIDIA Rapids has been deployed in a conda enviroment available in:

```
$WORLDWORK/stf011/nvrapids_0.11_gcc_6.4.0
```

You can activate this environment by first loading the next modules:

```
module load gcc/6.4.0
module load cuda/10.1.168
module load python/3.7.0-anaconda3-5.3.0
```

and then use the `source activate` command:

```
source activate $WORLDWORK/stf011/nvrapids_0.11_gcc_6.4.0
```

to deactivate the environment type:

```
source deactivate

```

## Running a DASK-cuda cluster in SUMMIT

Running NVIDIA Rapids distributed workloads requires a DASK-cuda cluster. Setting up a DASK-cuda cluster in SUMMIT
needs three components: dask-scheduler, dask-cuda-workers and python calls in your python script to
connect to the DASK-cuda cluster.

The next steps describe one of several ways to launch a dask-cuda cluster in SUMMIT using its custom LSF scheduler. 
In this particular case, a dask-scheduler is run in a batch node and dask-cuda-workers are run in compute nodes, then
additional dask-cuda-workers are spawn by submitting new batch jobs.

You might need to adapt these steps according to your needs, but it is desirable not to run dask-scheduler nor
dask-cuda-workers in SUMMIT's login nodes.

### Step 1. Launching the dask-scheduler and dask-cuda-workers

`launch_dask_cuda_cluster.lsf` script launches the dask-scheduler in a batch node and twelve dask-cuda-workers in two compute nodes. 

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#BSUB -P ABC123
#BSUB -W 1:00
#BSUB -alloc_flags "gpumps"
#BSUB -nnodes 2
#BSUB -J dask_cuda_worker
#BSUB -o dask_cuda_worker.o%J
#BSUB -e dask_cuda_worker.e%J

PROJ_ID=stf011

module load gcc/6.4.0
module load cuda/10.1.168

export PATH=$WORLDWORK/stf011/nvrapids_0.11_gcc_6.4.0/bin:$PATH

dask-scheduler --interface ib0 --scheduler-file $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID/my-scheduler-gpu.json --local-directory $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID &

jsrun -c 42 -g 6 -n 2 -r 1 -a 1 dask-cuda-worker --scheduler-file $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID/my-scheduler-gpu.json  --local-directory $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID  --nthreads 1 --memory-limit 100GB --device-memory-limit 16GB  --death-timeout 60 --interface ib0  --enable-infiniband --enable-nvlink

```

#### NOTES

DASK-cuda cluster connection information will be stored in `my-scheduler-gpu.json` file. See Step 2 for further instructions.

For a detailed explanation of dask-scheduler options, consult the next link:

https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/setup/cli.html

For a detailed explanation of dask-cuda-worker type the next command:

```
$dask-cuda-worker --help
```

For a detailed explanation of jsrun options, consult the next link:

https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/for-users/system-user-guides/summit/summit-user-guide/#job-launcher-(jsrun)

NUMBAPRO_NVVM and NUMBAPRO_LIBDEVICE where set to help Numba find libnvvm using SUMMIT's CUDA installation.


## Step 2. Get your code know about the DASK-cuda cluster

Once the script in Step 1. has passed through the  SUMMIT's batch queue and is running. You can submit your workload to the
DASK-cuda cluster by calling your script, in this example, from the login node:

```
$python verify_dask_cuda_cluster.py
```

Your python script, in this case `verify_dask_cuda_cluster.py`, should include the next python lines to connect to the DASK scheduler:

```
import os
from dask.distributed import Client

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    file = os.getenv('MEMBERWORK') + '/gen119/my-scheduler-gpu.json'
    client = Client(scheduler_file=file)
    print("client information ",client)
    print("Done!") 

```

After executing `verify_dask_cuda_worker.py` script, your output should be similar to this:

```
$python verify_dask_cuda_worker.py 
client information  <Client: scheduler='tcp://10.41.0.44:8786' processes=12 cores=72>
Done!
```

#### NOTES

Likely, your workload will require some compute intensive activity before connecting to the DASK-cuda cluster, thus is important
for you to consider to run your python script in a batch job.

### Step 3. Growing the DASK-cuda cluster

It is possible to grow and shrink Dask clusters based on current use. However, in contrast to the automatic  method, you can grow your dask-cuda cluster by submitting additional batch jobs after Step 1. is completed or shrink it by manually killing your running jobs accordingly.

`launch_dask_cuda_workers.lsf` script adds twelve new workers to your dask-cuda cluster:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#BSUB -P ABC123
#BSUB -W 1:00
#BSUB -alloc_flags "gpumps"
#BSUB -nnodes 2
#BSUB -J dask_cuda_worker
#BSUB -o dask_cuda_worker.o%J
#BSUB -e dask_cuda_worker.e%J

PROJ_ID=stf011

module load gcc/6.4.0
module load cuda/10.1.168

export PATH=$WORLDWORK/stf011/nvrapids_0.11_gcc_6.4.0/bin:$PATH

jsrun -c 42 -g 6 -n 2 -r 1 -a 1 dask-cuda-worker --scheduler-file $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID/my-scheduler-gpu.json  --local-directory $MEMBERWORK/$PROJ_ID  --nthreads 1 --memory-limit 100GB --device-memory-limit 16GB  --death-timeout 60 --interface ib0 --enable-infiniband --enable-nvlink
```

#### NOTES

Consider OLCF's scheduling policy when submitting jobs. Smaller jobs may be dispachted first than larger ones. For more information, consult the next link:
