## Instructions

The next instructions applies to NVIDIA Rapids ver. 0.9 and are intended for SUMMIT's users in GEN119 project, however
they can be used by other projects by changing the directory paths accordingly.

Running NVIDIA Rapids distributed workloads requires a DASK-cuda cluster. Setting up a DASK-cuda cluster in SUMMIT
needs three components: dask-cuda-scheduler, dask-cuda-workers and python calls in your python script to
connect to the DASK-cuda cluster.

The next steps describe one of several ways to launch a dask-cuda cluster in SUMMIT using its custom LSF scheduler. 
In this particular case, a dask-scheduler is run in a batch node and dask-cuda-workers are run in compute nodes, then
additional dask-cuda-workers are spawn by submitting new batch jobs.

You might need to adapt these steps according to your needs, but it is desirable not to run dask-scheduler nor
dask-cuda-workers in SUMMIT's login nodes.

Step 1. The next script launches the dask-scheduler in a batch node and two dask-cuda-workers in two compute nodes:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#BSUB -P ABC123
#BSUB -W 1:00
#BSUB -alloc_flags "gpumps"
#BSUB -nnodes 2
#BSUB -J dask_cuda_worker
#BSUB -o dask_cuda_worker.o%J
#BSUB -e dask_cuda_worker.e%J
